I highly reccomend watching Aperatus's video on how to apply all of these weird textures. Please note: I do not know, Nor does Aperatus know how to apply the M_Ex, Or Indirect_M textures yet. Ah, The many mysteries of Unreal Engine 4. Feel free to update this document if you find out how to do it, Or leave a comment on TMR. Because i ripped the models, No credit is required. Have fun with your Pikmin 4 model!
